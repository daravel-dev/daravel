# Changelog

All notable changes to the Daravel workspace (`daravel`, `daravel_test`,
`daravel_lints`, `dartisan_cli`). Versions follow SemVer; until 1.0.0 the
beta releases may still change Laravel-facing formats when the conformance
suite shows they differ from Laravel.

## Unreleased

### Added

- pub.dev readiness: package metadata (homepage, repository, issue tracker,
  documentation, topics, platforms), explicit `^1.0.0-beta.1` constraints
  between packages, per-package `README`, `CHANGELOG`, `LICENSE`,
  `example/main.dart` and `.pubignore`; CI runs `dart pub publish --dry-run`
  and `.github/workflows/publish.yml` publishes on `v*` tags with GitHub OIDC.
- `dartisan new --source=pub|git` (pub.dev by default, a plain pubspec without
  `dependency_overrides`).

- Support layer (BLUEPRINT_V2 §7.12): `Str` (case conversion, slug, slicing,
  predicates, secure random, UUID/ULID, English plural/singular), global
  helpers (`abortIf`, `abortUnless`, `retry`, `rescue`, `once`, `blank`,
  `filled`, `tap`, `value`, `dataGet`, `now`, `today`) and Laravel-style
  `Iterable` extensions (`pluck`, `keyBy`, `groupBy`, `chunk`, `unique`,
  `sumBy`, `avgBy`, `sortBy`, `sortByDesc`, `partition`); guide page
  `docs/guide/helpers.md` and `parity.yaml` entries.
- Conformance vectors from independent implementations: argon2id PHC strings
  (libargon2 via argon2-cffi, and Bun), `$2b$` bcrypt, an AES-256-GCM Laravel
  payload (BoringSSL); `201 Created` for resources of just-created models.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, trademark disclaimer and generated-code ownership in the
  README, fair-use rules in `docs/brand/README.md`, and a "Where Dart differs
  from PHP by design" table in the coexistence guide.

### Changed

- The repository moves to `github.com/daravel-dev/daravel` (URLs in docs,
  templates and metadata).

### Removed

- `CLAUDE.md` is no longer tracked (kept locally, like the blueprints).

### Changed (ADR-024: zero-config Laravel coexistence)

- `Crypt` defaults to AES-256-CBC (encrypt-then-HMAC-SHA256) and hashing to
  bcrypt with cost 12, Laravel's defaults; `APP_CIPHER=AES-256-GCM` and
  `HASH_DRIVER=argon2id` remain available. **Upgrade:** apps that relied on
  the old defaults should set them explicitly; existing argon2id hashes keep
  verifying and are rehashed to bcrypt at login.
- `HASH_VERIFY` now accepts hashes of the strong family (bcrypt, argon2id)
  across a driver switch, so `rehashPasswordIfRequired` can upgrade them;
  weaker foreign formats (pbkdf2) are still refused.

### Performance

- The rate limiter uses Laravel's fixed-window counter (hits + reset time,
  O(1) per key) instead of a sliding-window log that copied every timestamp
  on each request. Windows now start with the first hit, as in Laravel.
- The coordinator answers synchronous services inline (no Future per
  message) and the remote channel enforces timeouts with one sweep timer
  instead of a timer per call.
- With several isolates, generous limits (≥ 32) are served from adaptive
  local leases with unused hits released, and blocked keys are answered
  locally for up to 100 ms. On the benchmark (Windows, indicative) the
  throttled route went from 45% to 96% of the unthrottled throughput on one
  isolate and from 2.2k to 9.5k req/s on four.

## 1.0.0-beta.1 (Tier 1 / S14)

### Added

- **Conformance suite** (`packages/daravel/test/conformance`, tag
  `conformance`): error bodies (401/403/404/405/413/422/429/500), validation
  semantics and all default English messages (generated from Laravel 12's
  `lang/en/validation.php` by `tool/conformance/sync_laravel_messages.dart`),
  paginator, simple and cursor paginator JSON, resource wrapping, JSON dates,
  `apiResource` routes, Sanctum tokens, bcrypt, `Crypt` payloads (checked
  against an OpenSSL-built Laravel payload) and the schema of every table
  shared with Laravel.
- `package:daravel_test/conformance.dart`: `LaravelContract` fixtures and
  matchers (`isLaravelValidationError`, `isLaravelErrorBody`,
  `isLaravelLengthAwarePaginator`, `isLaravelPaginatedResource`) for
  application tests; new projects ship `test/conformance/`.
- **Security suite** (`packages/daravel/test/security`, tag `security`) for
  BLUEPRINT_V2 §9.3, and `SECURITY.md`.
- **`parity.yaml`** (ADR-016): the Laravel ⇄ Daravel symbol map, verified
  against the source by `test/parity_test.dart`.
- **Documentation site**: `docs/guide` (English, with Indonesian core pages),
  built by `tool/docs/generate.dart`, which also renders the parity table
  and inlines code samples from compiled tests; CI fails when the docs are
  stale; `.github/workflows/docs.yml` publishes to GitHub Pages when enabled.
- **Benchmark harness** (`bench/`, BLUEPRINT_V2 §10.2) with a plain
  `dart:io` reference and a nightly workflow gating > 10% regressions.
- `dartisan test [--conformance] [--security] [--coverage]`.
- Templates: `dart_test.yaml` and a CI workflow in both templates;
  `test/conformance` and `docker-compose.yml` (PostgreSQL 16) in `api`;
  `register` is throttled and runs in a transaction.
- `APP_CIPHER` (`AES-256-GCM` default, `AES-256-CBC` for Laravel's default),
  `SANCTUM_TOKEN_PREFIX`, `ModelDefinition.morphClass`, `Request.url`,
  `paginate()` page/path resolution from the current request,
  `withQueryString()` / `appends()`, `crc32b()`, `daravelVersion`.

### Changed (formats now identical to Laravel)

- Pagination: absolute URLs from the request, Laravel's `UrlWindow`, a `page`
  key in `links`, `current_page_url` for simple pagination, RFC 3986 query
  encoding, cursors encoded like `Cursor::encode()`
  (`_pointsToNextItems`, unpadded, PHP JSON escaping). **Cursors issued by
  earlier versions are no longer accepted.**
- Resource `meta` is derived from the paginator array like
  `PaginatedResourceResponse`.
- JSON dates have microseconds (`2026-01-02T03:04:05.000000Z`).
- `abort(code)` without a message renders `{"message": ""}`; 413 says
  `The POST data is too large.`; a 404 for the root route is labelled `/`.
- `ModelNotFoundException(model, [ids])`: message
  `No query results for model [App\Models\User] 1`.
- `personal_access_tokens.tokenable_type` defaults to the model's Laravel
  class (`App\Models\User` instead of `User`). **Upgrade:** run
  `UPDATE personal_access_tokens SET tokenable_type = 'App\Models\User'
  WHERE tokenable_type = 'User'`, or pass `morphClass: 'User'` to the
  `ModelDefinition`.
- New tokens follow Sanctum 4 (`{id}|{40 chars}{crc32b}`); existing tokens
  keep working.
- `cache.value` is `mediumText` and both `expiration` columns are indexed
  (new installs); the `migrations` table is created through the schema
  grammar on every driver.

### Security

- HTTP header names must be tokens and values may not contain CR, LF or NUL
  (response splitting).
- Failed logins for unknown accounts hash a dummy password, so response time
  does not reveal which accounts exist.
- The `url` rule rejects values over 8 192 characters, bounding validation
  time.

### Known gaps

MySQL driver, polymorphic relations, Blade, sessions/CSRF, multipart uploads,
mail, Redis and S3 are planned for Tier 2. Benchmark scenarios 7 (multipart)
and 8 (SSE) wait for those features.

## 0.0.1-dev (Tier 0, Tier 1 / S1–S13)

Walking skeleton and the Tier 1 core: container and zones, configuration,
HTTP kernel, routing, validation, query builder and grammars, the ORM,
schema and migrations, hashing, encryption and auth, multi-isolate serving,
cache and rate limiting, events, queues and scheduling, API resources,
storage, logging and metrics, the `dartisan` CLI with `new` and hot reload,
the testing toolkit, lints and architecture tests.
